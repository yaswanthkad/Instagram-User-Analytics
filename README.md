# Project Description
This project involves the design and analysis of a database for an Instagram-like social media platform. The primary objective is to provide a robust schema to store and manage user data, photo uploads, and interactions (comments). The SQL queries aim to implement the platform's core features, enabling insights into user engagement and content trends.
# Key Components of the Database:
Users Table: Stores user information, including a unique identifier, username, and account creation date.
Photos Table: Tracks photo uploads with image URLs, associated users, and timestamps.
Comments Table: Records comments on photos with text, timestamps, and user associations.
